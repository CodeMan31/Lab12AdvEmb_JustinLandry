Part 1
Worked well with no problems.
Part 2
This program could be very useful in variety of applications. Being able to capture images means you can do things with that image like face recognition, you could use to it work as vision for a robot, you could use it for motion control, etc. In conclusion this could be a very fundamental part of a variety of very cool advanced applications. 
Part 3
This program could be used to create a graphics editor like photoshop or to detect motion in an image. 
Part 4
This program could be used if you needed to simplify an image in order to analyze. If you wanted to write a program to determine the shape of something it would make it simpler to just view the lines.
Part 5
This program could also be used to create image manipulation software, image analysis software or could also be used to count specific shapes in an image; you could uses that data to recognize a specific object by comparing the lines and angles to set data.
Part 6
This program uses xml files to interrogate a video and detect if a face is included in the video. 
Conclusion
My project is a carbonation controller for beer, so this does not relate to it. I am definitely going to use some of this knowledge however for personal projects in the future. I would like to try to have a program that be used to recognize hands to control a smart mirror. I have seen smart mirror designs and they all obviously have the draw back that you must put your fingers on the mirror resulting in smudging. I don’t know how viable this is but it seems like a fun challenge
